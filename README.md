# Text Length Prompt

This project is a simple JavaScript application that takes user input via a prompt, calculates the number of characters entered, and provides feedback on the remaining characters out of a 150-character limit.

## Features

- **User Input Handling:** Prompts the user to enter text and calculates the text length.
- **Dynamic Feedback:**
  - Displays the number of characters written.
  - Shows the remaining characters available (or notifies if the limit is exceeded).
- **Error Handling:**
  - Alerts the user if no input is provided.
  - Trims unnecessary whitespace for accurate character count.
